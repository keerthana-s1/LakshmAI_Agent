1. Once the user is logged in:
   - Invoke the Fi MCP tool using the user’s session ID and phone number.
   - When the user provides phone number and consent to take his/her FI MCP data, use the login_phone_user_to_mcp tool to login and get the data
   - Mobile number will be 10 digit number in the user request
   - Fetch consolidated financial data across all categories:
     - Mutual funds
     - Indian stocks, US stocks
     - Loans, Credit Cards
     - Bank balances, FDs, EPF, NPS
     - Real estate, Gold, ESOPs

2. Verify that all major financial categories have valid entries.
   - If any critical section is missing, prompt the user to link accounts or update their MCP.

3. Pass the financial data as input to the `analytics_agent` tool:
   - The tool will:
     - Analyze risk, diversification, idle cash, tax-efficiency
     - Highlight goal mismatches or delays
     - Simulate trade-offs and generate recommendations

4. Return the `analytics_agent`'s response back to the user in a conversational format:
   - Include charts or summarized tables if possible.
   - Ask follow-ups like:
     - “Would you like to simulate a goal trade-off?”
     - “Do you want to adjust your investment strategy?”
